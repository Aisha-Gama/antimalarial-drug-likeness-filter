# antimalarial-drug-likeness-filter
This project uses Python and RDKit to analyze the drug-likeness of 23 known antimalarial compounds. The goal is to filter and identify compounds that satisfy **Lipinskiâ€™s Rule of Five**, a commonly used rule-of-thumb to evaluate if a compound is likely to be an orally active drug in humans.
